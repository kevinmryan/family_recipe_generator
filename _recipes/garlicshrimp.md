> **Ingredients**

---

* `⅓ cup` honey
* `¼ cup` soy sauce
* `12 cloves` garlic
* `1 tsp` minced fresh ginger (optional)

> Whisk the honey, soy sauce, garlic, and ginger (if using) together in a medium bowl. You will use half for the marinade in step 3 and half for cooking the shrimp in step 4.

---

* `1 lb` medium uncooked shrimp, peeled & deveined
* `½` the marinade from previous step

> Place shrimp in a large sealable container or zipped-top bag. Pour ½ of the marinade mixture on top, give it all a shake or stir, then allow shrimp to marinate in the refrigerator for `15 minutes` or for up to `8-12 hours`. Cover and refrigerate the rest of the marinade for step 4. (Time-saving tip: while the shrimp is marinating, we usually steam broccoli and microwave some quick brown rice.).

> Skewer the shrimp and cook on the grill! Make sure it's cooked on both sides. Pour any remaining marinade on the shrimp and serve.
