> **Ingredients**

---

> Add all ingredients into a medium saucepan and give it a stir. Turn heat to high and bring to a boil, stirring occasionally.

---

> Stir well, reduce heat to low, place lid on pot, and cook at a gentle simmer for `20 minutes` (or whatever amount of time is directed on your bag of rice; see NOTES below). 

---

> If rice is not quite tender or liquid is not absorbed after `20 minutes`, replace lid and cook for `2 - 4 minutes` longer. Remove from heat, leave covered, and allow to rest for a few minutes. Fluff rice with a fork and serve.
