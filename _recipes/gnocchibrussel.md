* `1 lb` halved brussel sprouts
* `1` lemon
* `¼ cup` olive oil
* `½ tsp` salt
* `1 tsp` cracked pepper
* `½ tsp` red-pepper flakes
* `18 oz` potato gnocchi
* `5 tbsp` unsalted butter, sliced
* `½ tsp` honey
* `to taste` fresh grated Parmesan

> **Ingredients**

---

* `1 lb` halved brussel sprouts
* `1` lemon

> Trim and halve the brussels sprouts. Using a vegetable peeler, peel thick strips of lemon zest, then coarsely chop. (You should have about 2 teaspoons chopped zest.)

---

* `¼ cup` olive oil
* `½ tsp` salt
* `1 tsp` cracked pepper
* `½ tsp` red-pepper flakes
* `18 oz` potato gnocchi

> In a large skillet, heat 3 tablespoons olive oil over medium-high. Add the brussels sprouts, season with ½ teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper, then arrange the brussels sprouts in an even layer, cut-side down. Scatter the lemon zest over the top and cook, undisturbed, until the brussels sprouts are well browned underneath, `3 to 5 minutes`. Add the red-pepper flakes, stir and cook until the brussels sprouts are crisp-tender, `2 to 3 minutes`. Transfer to a medium bowl.

---

* `5 tbsp` unsalted butter, sliced
* `½ tsp` honey

> In the same skillet, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil over medium-high. Break up any gnocchi that are stuck together, add them to the pan and cook, covered and undisturbed, until golden brown on one side, 2 to 4 minutes. Add the butter and honey, season with salt and a generous amount of black pepper, and cook, stirring, until the butter is golden, nutty smelling and foaming, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in the brussels sprouts until warmed through.
