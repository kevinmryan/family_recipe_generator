## For Salad

---

* `1 head` lacinato kale
* `to taste` grated parmesan
* `1-2` avocados
* `1` cucumber
* `2-3` radishes

> Slice cucumber and radishes with a mandolin slicer. Combine ingredients in salad bowl.

## For Dressing

---

* `1` lemon's worth of juice
* `2 cloves` garlic, minced
* `to taste` hot peper flakes
* `to taste` dash salt and pepper
* `3 tbsp` olive oil

> Combine lemon juice, garlic, pepper flakes, salt, and pepper into a bowl.  Slowly whisk in the olive oil.  Ideally the dressing emulsifies, but not necessary.

> Power dressing onto salad, toss well, wait `5 minutes` before eating so cale breaks down from the lemon and oil.
