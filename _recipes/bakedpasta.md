> **Ingredients**

---

* `3 tbsp` extra-virgin olive oil
* `14 oz` Beyond sausage (4 links) 
* `4 cloves` garlic, thinly sliced
* `1 tsp` dried oregano
* `1 pinch` red-pepper flakes

> Heat oven to `425 °F`. Heat oil in a 12-inch ovenproof skillet over medium-high. Crumble sausage into skillet, using a spoon to break it into small pieces. Cook until starting to brown, stirring occasionally, `5 - 7 minutes`. Stir in garlic, oregano, fennel seeds and red-pepper flakes (if using), and cook another `1 - 2 minutes`.

* `1 can (28 oz)` whole peeled tomatoes w/ juices
* `1 can (14 oz)` crushed tomatoes
* `2` bay leaves
* `2 tsp` Kosher salt

> Stir in whole tomatoes and their juice, using a spoon to break them up. Add crushed tomatoes, bay leaves and `2 teaspoons` salt, and bring to a simmer. Simmer for `10 minutes` to thicken slightly.

* `12 oz` dried pasta, shaped (shells, farfalle)
* `⅓ of 8 oz` fresh mozzarella, torn into bite-size pieces

> Stir in pasta and `1 cup` water and return to a simmer. Continue to simmer for `2 minutes`, stirring frequently to make sure pasta doesn’t stick to the bottom of the pan. Remove from heat, pluck out the bay leaves, and fold in about a third of the mozzarella.

---

* `⅔ of 8 oz` fresh mozzarella, torn into bite-size pieces
* `6 oz` whole milk ricotta (¾ cup)
* `⅓ cup` grated Parmesan
* `¼ cup` basil leaves

> Top pasta with remaining mozzarella and dollops of ricotta. Sprinkle with Parmesan, then transfer to oven. Bake until pasta is tender when poked with a fork, and cheese is bubbly and lightly golden, `18 - 22 minutes`. (If you’d like a more deeply browned topping, run the pan under the broiler for `1 - 2` minutes.) Remove from oven and let cool slightly before serving. Top with basil, plenty of black pepper, and more red-pepper flakes, if you like.
